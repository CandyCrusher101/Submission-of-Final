#Download the game from itch.io (username is CandyCrusher101)
#This is a zip file, once you open it up, you can play the game

#If a message comes up saying it won't be able to open up because its from the internet, go to system preferences and change it so that you can open applications downloaded from the internet
#This is not a virus, your computer is just trying to keep you safe
#For apple: system preferences>security and privacy>general>"allow apps downloaded from..." and allow the game to run.

#I tested this out on my brother's computer and it worked
#Ignore all the other repositories, that was just proof of me trying to figure out how to upload the game directly to github lol
